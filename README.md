# Multiclass-Classification-Digits-Dataset-using-deep-learning
This project focuses on implementing a multiclass classification model using Scikit-learn's digits dataset, which consists of 1,797 samples and 64 features, where each feature represents a pixel in an 8×8 image of a handwritten digit (0-9). The main objectives are:

Model Training: The project trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using different optimization algorithms, specifically Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam. These optimizers are essential for efficiently minimizing the loss function during the training process.

Performance Comparison: A key aspect of the project is to compare the performance of the two optimizers by analyzing their loss over iterations. This includes visualizing the training loss curves to understand how each optimizer converges during the training process.

Confusion Matrix Analysis: To evaluate the classification performance across all 10 digit classes, confusion matrices will be computed. These matrices provide a clear insight into the model’s accuracy, indicating which digits are frequently misclassified and helping identify areas for improvement.

Insights and Conclusions: The project will conclude with insights derived from the performance metrics, including recommendations for choosing optimization algorithms in multiclass classification tasks.
